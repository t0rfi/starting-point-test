## Codebase Patterns
- Next.js 16 with App Router (src/app directory structure)
- Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/postcss
- TypeScript 5 with strict mode
- Use `npm run typecheck` to verify TypeScript compilation
- Folder structure: src/components, src/lib, src/types
- PRD types (Feature, UserStory, PRD) exported from src/types/prd.ts

# Progress Log

## 2026-02-13T17:37:00Z - US-001
- Initialized Next.js 16.1.6 project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS v4
- Created basic folder structure: src/components, src/lib, src/types
- Added typecheck script to package.json
- Verified `npm run dev` starts successfully
- Verified `npm run typecheck` passes
- Files created/modified:
  - package.json (project config with typecheck script)
  - tsconfig.json (TypeScript config)
  - next.config.ts (Next.js config)
  - postcss.config.mjs (PostCSS/Tailwind config)
  - eslint.config.mjs (ESLint config)
  - src/app/* (default app structure)
  - src/components/.gitkeep, src/lib/.gitkeep, src/types/.gitkeep
  - .gitignore
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Next.js 16 uses Turbopack by default for faster dev builds
  - Tailwind v4 uses @tailwindcss/postcss instead of tailwindcss/postcss
  - create-next-app requires empty directory; use temp directory workaround for existing repos

## 2026-02-13T17:42:00Z - US-002
- Defined TypeScript types for PRD data structure
- Created types for UserStory, Feature, PRD root, and TokenUsage
- All types exported from central types file (src/types/prd.ts)
- Types include JSDoc comments for documentation
- Files created:
  - src/types/prd.ts (PRD type definitions)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PRD types are in src/types/prd.ts - import from there for type safety
  - TokenUsage is optional on UserStory (only tracked for completed stories)
  - startedAt, completedAt, durationSeconds, notes are all optional on UserStory
